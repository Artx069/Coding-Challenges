Kiyo has been given a series of problems and she needs your help to solve them!

You will be given a two-dimensional array such as the one below.

a = 
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
]

Remove everything but odd integers from each sub-array.

Sum the remaining odd integers of each sub-array. 

Sum of odds ( a[0] = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 ) = 25
       
Find the Least common multiple of the arrays.

 (25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25)
  ^                                ^ 
  |                                |
a[0]-----------------------------a[8]

example : lcm( 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25 ) = 25

example : lcm( 37, 29, 19, 38, 31, 28, 15, 24, 9 ) = 1592632440
Integers are between 0 and 9. Sub-array size is always 9. The number of sub-arrays varies between 9 and 18.

Watch out for non-integers mixed in the arrays. If all arrays are empty return 0.
